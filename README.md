# Alibaba Cloud Tutorials

I joined Alibaba Cloud starting Jan 2019. Since then, I worked on several projects and have learnt some advanced technologies. Somehow, those technologies are difficult for English spearking developers to just get started. In this repository I will save those tutorials useful solutions for solving different business or technical problems. I will try to make sample programs as easier as possible to reproduce, so that you may copy some of them. Most code would be in Python 3.

Hope they are useful to someone. If you found error, raise an ticket against this repository. 


## Getting Started

You need to setup your own cridentials for run the samples.
